//! In-app updates — the shared module every Fox desktop app carries.
//!
//! This file is deliberately **identical** in wispr-fox, FoxCull, Fox MD
//! (md-reader) and Fox Mark. Only the three constants in the "Per-app
//! configuration" block below differ. If you fix something here, fix it in all
//! four — a divergence is a bug, not a customisation.
//!
//! ## What it does
//!
//! One screen answers three separate questions — *what am I running*, *what is
//! the newest stable*, *is there a newer nightly* — and one button moves
//! between them. On Windows that button is genuinely one click: the installer
//! is downloaded, run silently, and the app relaunches itself. No wizard, no
//! uninstall/reinstall, no trip to a browser.
//!
//! ## Why not `tauri-plugin-updater`
//!
//! The plugin resolves ONE update per endpoint from a signed `latest.json`
//! manifest, and wants a keypair whose private half lives in CI secrets.
//! GitHub's `releases/latest` deliberately excludes pre-releases and there is
//! no "latest pre-release" equivalent, so a two-channel picker would need a
//! second hand-published manifest. These apps ship unsigned builds from public
//! repos, so the signing apparatus would buy nothing and cost a key-management
//! story. This reads the public releases API instead: no new secrets, no
//! release-pipeline change.
//!
//! ## Two consequences worth knowing
//!
//! - **Nightlies must be published pre-releases, not drafts.** GitHub does not
//!   return draft releases to an unauthenticated caller, so a draft nightly is
//!   invisible here. Every repo's `release.yml` publishes `*-nightly*` tags as
//!   pre-releases for exactly this reason.
//! - **The network call lives in Rust, not the webview.** These apps run a
//!   strict CSP with no `connect-src` for external hosts, and opening one up to
//!   reach api.github.com would widen the attack surface of every page the
//!   renderer touches. Rust fetches; the frontend only sees the result.
//!
//! ## Trust boundary
//!
//! Downloads come only from `browser_download_url` values the GitHub API
//! returned for **this** repository, over HTTPS, to a host on a small
//! allowlist, and the finished file must match the byte size the API declared.
//! Nothing here builds a URL from renderer input — `download_and_install` takes
//! a *tag*, re-resolves it server-side, and never accepts a URL across the IPC
//! boundary. The installer fetched is the same unsigned artifact the user would
//! otherwise download by hand; this is strictly less error-prone than that.
